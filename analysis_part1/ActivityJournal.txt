Implement these functions in the order below.

Your name: Kyle McCoy

================================================================
create_node
Start
Estimated Time	05 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	I tried to follow the steps one at a time as the top
	of the function comments required, I looked over the 
	lecture slides multiple times, attempted compiling
	after each line to ensure no errors	

Complete
Actual Time	01 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	strcpy() was creating a warning from the system,
	the system said to use strlcpy() instead so I googled
	it and figured out how to use the function correctly

================================================================
add_node_at_head
Start
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	follow the steps and hints carefully, check for any 
	clues in the lecture slides

Complete
Actual Time	01 20
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	I had to go back and fix my create_node function
	as it passed all the tests but still didn't work 
	correctly when called

================================================================
clear_linked_list
Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	similarly to the last functions I simply took a look
	at the lecture notes to see if they would lend any help
	on the order in which to free things

Complete
Actual Time	00 30
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	I used an example from the lecture notes to base my
	function on, the hints from the comments helped, the 
	output from failing a test reminded me to set the
	pointers to NULL when the loop is done

================================================================
add_node_after_current
Start
Estimated Time	HH MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	HH MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
find_word
Start
Estimated Time	HH MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	HH MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
