Ruby – Diet Manager

Name:	Kyle McCoy

NOTE: Create additional Part 1 & 2 log entries 
based on the order of implementation.

================================================================
Part 1 – Product & Unit Test Classes – Start
Estimated Time  06 09	
Plan for this level:
	Implement each function in the class then write test
	cases to each method after the class is done, correct
	implementation errors as necessary

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1: FoodDB.rb & FoodDBTest.rb
Estimated Time  00 45
Plan for this level:
	Implement each function following steps from the comments

Actual Time  00 20
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	Only problem encountered was with adding a recipe that
	contained another recipe, it was a quick fix to changing
	get_food to get

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1: BasicFood.rb & BasicFoodTest.rb
Estimated Time  00 10
Plan for this level:
	implement each function following the steps from comments

Actual Time  00 05
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	Easy implementation, no problems, tests are annoying

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1: Recipe.rb & RecipeTest.rb
Estimated Time  00 10
Plan for this level:
	implement as the comments explain to

Actual Time  00 05
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	easy implementation, no problems encountered

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1: LogItem.rb & LogItemTest.rb
Estimated Time  00 20
Plan for this level:
        implement as comments and follow similar pattern to
	previous code and BasicFood and Recipe

Actual Time  00 15
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
        no problems, implementation went as expected

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1: Log.rb & LogTest.rb
Estimated Time  00 30
Plan for this level:
        implement as the comments explain to, follow similar
	implementation and planning that FoodDB.rb required

Actual Time  00 20
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
        implementation took a little bit longer but still easily
	done

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1 – Product & Unit Test Classes – Completed
Actual Time	01 05
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	Most of the implementation for the project was already
	filled in mainly the tests in that regard, and implementing
	the rest of the code was easy thanks to the commenting

================================================================
Part 2 – DietManager Levels – Start
Estimated Time	08 00
Plan for this level:
	work slowly using previous code implementation strategy
	to ensure implementation will work with previous code
	read from the project assignment website for help or hints

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Level 1
Estimated Time  00 30
Plan for this level:
	should be easy enough to make the input break if quit is 
	typed in, print all should be a simple each loop

Actual Time  00 15
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	implementation was quick and simple, most code already
	written for me

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Level 2
Estimated Time 00 30
Plan for this level:
	print should be an easy implementation as it just uses
	get from the database, prefix should also be easy as
	it uses find_matches

Actual Time 00 15
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	implementation went as expected, no obstacles yet

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Level 3
Estimated Time 00 30
Plan for this level:
	things should be getting more complicated as I have to
	implement more checks for if the food is one word or two
	words, and recipe will have a similar problem

Actual Time  00 20
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	the only really difficult part was figuring out how to
	ensure spaces are left in the name of the food before
	being passed into the functions

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Level 4
Estimated Time 00 30
Plan for this level:
	i can already see that finding away to separate how log 
	is being called could be a pain, show all should be 
	manageable with a loop

Actual Time  00 40
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	there was an intial problem where i didn't realize i 
	has to parse the Date into the function but quickly 
	figured it out, the DietLog.txt kept getting spaced up
	which made me changed my to string for LogItem

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Level 5
Estimated Time 00 30
Plan for this level:
	implement show in the same style of log in terms of date
	and passing things into the function, delete should be 
	the similar to add

Actual Time 00 30
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	implementation was pretty quick considering they were
	similar functions to the previous level, the date time
	parse was what really slowed me down

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2 – DietManager Levels – Completed
Actual Time	02 00
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	things started out pretty quickly but soon I had to 
	make changes and implement things carefully to ensure
	nothing would mess up the other parts of the code

================================================================
Overall Summary
Estimated Total Time	16 00
Actual Total Time	03 05
Project reflection:
	this project was a good way of making me learn and look 
	up the code i plan on implementing, there was a lot more
	time spent planning and testing than any other activites
	done so far
