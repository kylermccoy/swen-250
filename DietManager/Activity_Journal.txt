NOTE: Create additional Part 1 & 2 log entries 
based on the order of implementation.

================================================================
Part 1 – Product & Unit Test Classes – Start
Estimated Time  06 09	
Plan for this level:
	Implement each function in the class then write test
	cases to each method after the class is done, correct
	implementation errors as necessary

Part 1: FoodDB.rb & FoodDBTest.rb
Estimated Time  00 45
Plan for this level:
	Implement each function following steps from the comments

Actual Time  00 20
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	Only problem encountered was with adding a recipe that
	contained another recipe, it was a quick fix to changing
	get_food to get

Part 1: BasicFood.rb & BasicFoodTest.rb
Estimated Time  00 10
Plan for this level:
	implement each function following the steps from comments

Actual Time  00 05
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	Easy implementation, no problems, tests are annoying

Part 1: Recipe.rb & RecipeTest.rb
Estimated Time  00 10
Plan for this level:
	implement as the comments explain to

Actual Time  00 05
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
	easy implementation, no problems encountered

Part 1: Log.rb & LogTest.rb
Estimated Time  00 20
Plan for this level:
        implement as comments and follow similar pattern to
	previous code

Actual Time  00 15
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
        no problems, implementation went as expected

Part 1: LogItem.rb & LogItemTest.rb
Estimated Time  00 30
Plan for this level:
        implement as the comments explain to, follow similar
	implementation and planning that Log.rb required

Actual Time  00 20
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
        implementation took a little bit longer but still easily
	done

Part 1 – Product & Unit Test Classes – Completed
