SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name:	Kyle McCoy

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	work slowly on one function, look at helpful tips
	and tricks from the assignment page and the lecture
	slides, look through the test code to see what needs
	to happen and how

Complete
Actual Time	01 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	ran tests after each implemented function, after doing
	the functions with the indexing using the pointers
	was a fairly simple transition, I over thought the 
	final function by thinking there was some fancy easy
	way of completeing it and tried to use the older
	functions instead of just implementing it normally
