Database -- SQL Practice - Relational Joins

Name:	Kyle McCoy

================================================================
Queries 1 through 10:
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	read each commented query carefully and attempt to 
	implement each select line as required, check powerpoint
	for any useful tips or tricks for implementing

Complete
Actual Time	01 20
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	at first it was difficult to remember to link each 
	databass with equals in the where block, once I started
	getting a handle on how to implement the where blocks

================================================================
Queries 11 through 15 (extra credit if done):
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	implement the select blocks similarly to the previous,
	use the hints provided in the comments

Complete
Actual Time	00 25
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	the select blocks were easy to implement thanks to the
	functions told to use by the tips
