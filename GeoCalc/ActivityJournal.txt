SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name:	Kyle McCoy

================================================================
Start activity 1 -- complete and test the Line class in line.rb
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	uses distance formula to determine length between lines,
	use tests for zero, negatives, and positives

Complete
Actual Time	00 10
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	test cases went without a hitch, implementation of length
	was a success

================================================================

Start activity 2 -- complete and test the Circle class in circle.rb
Estimated Time	00 20
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	follow steps from comments in the code, follow similar
	style and format of line

Complete
Actual Time	00 15
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	took a bit longer, had to figure out proper calling
	methods of the variable and the methods

================================================================

Start activity 3 -- complete and test the Rectangle class in rectangle.rb
Estimated Time	00 15
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	follow similar implementation to circle, follow the 
	example and plan in the comments

Complete
Actual Time	00 05
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	took long only because of defining the methods, same
	implementation style and example as circle
