================================================================
Part 1
Estimated Time	
Plan:		00 30
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	open the code and get a good look at it, check the 
	lecture notes and slides to see if there is anything
	useful to the task	

Complete
Actual Time	00 20
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	the ending character for an array is extremely important
	otherwise it kept reprinting any characters from the 
	previous line that was longer than the current line

================================================================
Part 2
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	check the lecture notes to see if there is anything
	helpful about copying data types

Complete
Actual Time	00 15
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	when copying an array you have to use a loop and
	individually copy each attribute, had to add two
	variables to the main function to check for greatest
	input size and another to hold the information
	of the input with the greatest size
