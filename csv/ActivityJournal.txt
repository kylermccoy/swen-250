SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Kyle McCoy

================================================================
Implement code to pass all unit tests

Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	Check lecture notes for any helpful bits of code,
	Read assignment site over a second time, read each 
	function's comments and hints carefully, slowly
	implement each function, test slight changes after 
	implementations

Complete
Actual Time	04 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	struggled trying to understand exactly what the 
	assignment was trying to tell me to do for each 
	function, when I finally figured out what they 
	wanted I had a hard time trying to implement it
	correctly, requested some help from those around
	me, finally understood how the code was supposed 
	to work after careful explanations


================================================================
Test correct operation from the command line

Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	after completeing implementation run the tests
	if test fail check code slowly, compile the actual
	version and compare the outputs

Complete
Actual Time	01 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
	test failed quite often, my get_line function was
	skipping over fields, after modifying it started
	passing more of the tests, everything compiled
	compared output, everything seemed correct,
	uploaded to git
